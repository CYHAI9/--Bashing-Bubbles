There are many bubbles falling down. If you want to break it, please hit it with your fingers. The speed of the bubbles varies with the difficulty factor, depending on the speed of the finger. Our projectiles are not fired regularly, but by the finger button frequency output, so your hand speed determines your game score. Come on, join us in beating bubbles.
